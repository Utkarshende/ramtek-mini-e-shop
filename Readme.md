# 🛒 [Ramtek Bazar](https://ramtek-shop.netlify.app)

Ramtek Bazar is a hyper-local C2C (Consumer-to-Consumer) marketplace designed to connect local buyers and sellers. It allows users to list pre-owned or new items, browse categories, and manage their own local shop digitally.

> **Note:** This may take 1-2 minutes to load data from the server on the first visit. We are using the free tier of Render to host our backend, which goes to "sleep" after 15 minutes of inactivity.

Visit the 👉🏻 [live demo](https://ramtek-shop.netlify.app) to see it in action!
